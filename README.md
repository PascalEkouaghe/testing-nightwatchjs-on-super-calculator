# Testing nightwatch on angular application

This is just a simple POC to see how to write tests with nightwatch for angular applications.  
Ensure ./nightwatch has rights to be launched.
Then run './nightwatch -c test/config/nightwatch.json'.
There is one test that purposely fails to display an error message.
