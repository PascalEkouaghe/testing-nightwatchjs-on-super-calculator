# Testing nightwatch on angular application

This is just a simple POC to see how to write tests with nightwatch for angular applications.  
I run these tests against http://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo/.  
Ensure ./nightwatch has rights to be launched.  
Then run `./nightwatch -c test/config/nightwatch.json`.  
There is one test that purposely fails to display an error message.
